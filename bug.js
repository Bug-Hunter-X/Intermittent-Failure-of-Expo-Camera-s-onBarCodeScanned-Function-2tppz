This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The expected behavior is that the function should be called whenever a barcode is scanned. However, sometimes the function is not called at all, or it's called intermittently, making barcode scanning unreliable. This seems to be linked to performance issues or race conditions within the Expo Camera API, especially when dealing with high-resolution images or multiple barcode types.  The problem manifests itself inconsistently and is difficult to reproduce reliably.
